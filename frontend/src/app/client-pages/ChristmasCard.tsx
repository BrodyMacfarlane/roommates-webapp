            Emily — It’s getting more and more challenging to find words to
            describe our relationship and my feelings around it... Solely
            because it’s the biggest source of absolute happiness, love,
            vulnerability, intimacy, and acceptance that I have ever had in my
            life.
          </p>
          <p>I love you for everything you are. </p>
